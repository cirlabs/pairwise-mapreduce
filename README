Test locally with this command within download directory:

cat input.txt | python ./inv-index-mapper.py | sort -k1,1 | ./inv-index-reducer.py \
| ./pairwise-mapper.py | sort -k1,1 | ./pairwise-reducer.py

Output should be:

"1|2"   2
"1|4"   2
"1|7"   1
"2|4"   1
"2|7"   1
"3|5"   1
"4|7"   1
"7|6"   2
"8|6"   2
"8|7"   1
